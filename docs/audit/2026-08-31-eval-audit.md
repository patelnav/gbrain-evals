# What the August 31, 2026 audit changed

The audit made gbrain's evaluation suite more useful by finding cases where a good-looking score did not mean what it appeared to mean. This report records the investigation and its fixes. The detailed evidence, code locations and verification decisions remain in [2026-08-31-findings.json](2026-08-31-findings.json).

A benchmark is software too. A broken denominator, an ignored setting or a missing input can make an apparent improvement disappear when checked. Fixing these problems made it possible to compare later gbrain changes on a clearer basis.

## How the investigation worked

The workflow used 35 agents: 17 examined separate areas, independent reviewers tried to refute each finding against the code and pinned gbrain v0.47.6.0 source, and a final reviewer checked coverage. Two Codex review rounds examined the remediation plan.

The result was **237 confirmed findings and two refuted findings, 239 in total**. Confirmation means the reviewers found supporting code evidence; it does not mean every historical score was rerun.

| Class | Count |
|---|---|
| Critical: wrong scores, ineffective tests or crashes | 17 |
| Major: misleading metrics, silent skips or information leaks | 95 |
| Minor bugs | 81 |
| Evaluation-design improvements | 44 |
| Refuted during verification | 2 |

## The four most useful lessons

**Finding one required source is not finding all the evidence.** The LongMemEval runner counted a question as recalled when any required session appeared in the top five. The official metric requires every required session. That made the published 97.60% comparison incorrect under the strict metric. The later offline rescore produced 83.40% for the same hybrid run; see the [dated report](../benchmarks/2026-05-07-longmemeval-s.md).

**The denominator is part of the result.** Duplicate chunks could be counted as separate recalled pages, allowing recall above 1.0. Precision divided by the number of returned items rather than k, rewarding an adapter for returning a shorter list. A model judge could omit rubric criteria and have the remaining scores silently rescaled. These were shared scoring problems, not evidence that one search method was better.

**A test must have a reachable failure.** Four runners crashed against the pinned dependency. Roughly a dozen other tests could not meaningfully fail: missing fixtures counted as success, corpora were smaller than the retrieval cutoff, or a printed threshold did not affect the exit code. A negative control deliberately weakens the tested behavior so we can check that the score falls.

**A named configuration must actually run.** Ambient credentials could enable reranking inside an “embedder-only” comparison. Other settings were written under names no code read. A shell-expansion bug killed four of seven shootout cells with exit 127 while the wrapper still printed completion. Configuration records and observed behavior are both needed.

## Changes recorded for BrainBench v0.5.0

The shared metrics moved into one implementation. LongMemEval gained explicit all-session recall, and model judges had to return the complete required rubric. The resulting scores are not directly comparable with pre-audit scoring.

A common receipt format distinguishes completed, failed, skipped and invalid runs. System-under-test failures remain scored misses; harness errors are recorded and excluded only within the defined limit. A skipped category must not become a pass merely because a wrapper completed. Cat35's separate receipt-convention follow-up is tracked in [TODOS.md](../../TODOS.md).

Tests gained stated feature boundaries and negative controls. The degraded configuration rule was a score at most half the real configuration's score; live API-dependent confirmation remained separate work.

Data checks became repeatable: page counts, file references, answer-label consistency and saved baselines are checked in CI. The synthetic corpus's broken person-to-company links were repaired, and a first-result qrel was corrected with a written explanation.

CI gained type checks, unit tests, data validation, the keyword baseline check and selected real offline runners. This is a check of the harness and selected behaviors; it does not mean every paid benchmark runs on every PR.

## Recorded disposition of the findings

The table below is the audit's recorded status, preserved from its findings data. “Fixed” describes the code or documentation remediation. For some findings, confirming the new live model score remained a separate task.

The deferred finding, `skillopt-cats-11`, concerns deep imports into gbrain's source. A public SkillOpt export would let these runners work across more package-installation layouts.

| adapters-queries-08 | major | improvement | fixed | cosine() silently truncates on dimension mismatch (Math.min), producing plausible garbage instead of failing loud |
| adapters-queries-09 | minor | improvement | fixed | Validator enforces gold shape for only 2 of 8 expected_output_types |
| orchestrators-01 | critical | bug | fixed | Env-prefix built from ${reranker:+VAR=val} is not an assignment; all 4 reranker cells die with exit 127 |
| orchestrators-02 | major | bug | fixed | `run_cell ... \|\| {...}` suspends set -e inside run_cell; gbrain eval and scoring failures are silently ignored and a partial run can be scored and locked in |
| orchestrators-03 | major | bug | fixed | gbrain version gate is an allowlist of 0.35.x-0.36.x that rejects every newer version, including the repo's pinned gbrain (0.47.6.0) |
| orchestrators-04 | major | bug | fixed | GBRAIN_RERANKER_MODEL / GBRAIN_SEARCH_RERANKER_ENABLED (and GBRAIN_SEARCH_MODE) env vars are not read anywhere in gbrain; reranker cells would run without reranking even if the prefix bug were fixed |
| orchestrators-05 | major | bug | fixed | evaluate_qa.py invoked with --input/--output flags and no reference file, which does not match LongMemEval's published evaluator interface |
| orchestrators-06 | major | bug | fixed | Driver failures are silently swallowed: errexit is suspended inside run_cell and the \|\| handler is dead code, so a failed cell prints '-> done' |
| orchestrators-07 | major | bug | fixed | Phase 2 'long-haystack' gate is fake: gbrain's embed() truncates every input to 8,000 chars before the provider call, so the ~50K-token payload never reaches the API |
| orchestrators-08 | major | bug | fixed | Report header and repro instructions present BRAINBENCH_N as the run-count knob, but no dispatched subprocess Cat reads it |

| orchestrators-12 | minor | bug | fixed | BRAINBENCH_N parsed with Number() and no guard: NaN/0/empty value makes zero runs and crashes on runResults[0] |

| orchestrators-14 | minor | bug | fixed | Suite always exits 0 even when every cat fails; STAMP is dead code |
| orchestrators-15 | minor | bug | fixed | Relational query builder claims to 'mirror multi-adapter.ts' but drops 2 of its 4 templates, so receipts are not comparable to multi-adapter scorecards |
| orchestrators-16 | minor | bug | fixed | Timeout path sends SIGTERM only with no SIGKILL escalation; a hung cat keeps its ~400MB PGLite instance alive while the next cat starts |
| orchestrators-17 | major | improvement | fixed | No pass/fail thresholds: the runner exits 0 whenever it doesn't crash, so all.ts's Cat 1 '✓ pass' only means 'ran to completion' |
| orchestrators-18 | minor | improvement | fixed | gbrain dependency pinned to a moving branch (#master), making benchmark results non-reproducible across installs |
| orchestrators-19 | minor | improvement | fixed | Phase 2 skips the smoke gate that smoke.ts documents as the per-cell pre-flight, so a misconfigured cell burns the full 240-page embed spend before failing |

| agentic-cats-16 | minor | bug | fixed | Transcript schema's probe_id pattern rejects the transcripts the adapter actually produces |
| agentic-cats-17 | minor | improvement | fixed | Flight-recorder is never wired in: cat8/cat9 discard transcripts and emitBundle has zero runner callers |
| agentic-cats-18 | minor | improvement | fixed | No runtime schema validation of emitted artifacts against eval/schemas/*.json |
| agentic-cats-19 | minor | improvement | fixed | tier_escalation 'simple' tier has no upper bound, so over-tooling can never fail |

| calibration-cats-03 | major | bug | fixed | Implemented gates diverge from the documented rubric; two core positive-axis gates are missing entirely |

| cats18-21-11 | major | bug | fixed | Failed queries are dropped from the denominator (continue), so cells are compared at unequal n and errors inflate per-cell MRR/recall |
| cats18-21-12 | major | bug | fixed | Brainstorm errors are swallowed and the judge is still run on an empty ideas string; its scores are averaged into the headline means with no error marker |
| cats18-21-13 | major | bug | fixed | recall_at_5 increments once per matching chunk row, so a single query can contribute more than 1 |

| precisionmembench-03 | major | bug | fixed | Report filename and payload omit the run config (entityMax/otherMax/limit/noEmbed), so same-day adaptive runs with different caps silently overwrite each other and published numbers lose provenance |
| precisionmembench-04 | minor | bug | refuted | --json mode leaves console unsilenced during engine init + seeding, so gbrain migrate/import logs pollute the machine-readable stdout |
| precisionmembench-05 | minor | bug | fixed | Separatrix capture keys perQuery by raw query text, so cases sharing a query overwrite each other's captured scores |
| precisionmembench-06 | minor | improvement | fixed | Leaderboard comparison prints partial-run gbrain numbers next to full 77-case published numbers with no n annotation |
| precisionmembench-07 | minor | improvement | fixed | Cliff gate normalizes by `sorted[0].score \|\| 1e-9`, which sign-flips gap ratios and silently disables the cliff when the ordering-driving score is negative (post-rerank case the file claims to support) |
| generators-01 | major | bug | fixed | Contradiction and stale-fact fixtures are planted on a single item each; the required counterpart source never exists |
| generators-02 | major | bug | fixed | Implicit-preference fixtures (pref-001..003) are declared but never planted in any corpus item |
| generators-03 | major | bug | fixed | The 6 templated docs are never added to corpus-manifest.json items (and land in doc/, not the documented docs/) |
| generators-04 | major | bug | fixed | world-v1 cache key is the slug alone — changed facts, prompt, or model never invalidate cached pages |
| generators-05 | major | bug | fixed | Deal slugs are not unique — one of 15 generated deal pages is silently overwritten; manifest overcounts |
| generators-06 | major | bug | fixed | person/concept/project wikilinks omit the -index suffix, so every person->company link in the committed corpus is dangling |
| generators-07 | major | bug | fixed | A --max run silently truncates the committed corpus files, and --max without a value is silently ignored |
| generators-08 | minor | bug | fixed | Meetings link calendar events whose date and counterparty disagree with the meeting, planting unbudgeted contradictions |
| generators-09 | minor | bug | fixed | Reply emails share a thread_id but draw a fresh random counterparty, so email threads are incoherent |
| generators-10 | minor | bug | fixed | Manifest generated_at uses new Date(), so every warm-cache regeneration dirties the committed corpus-manifest.json |
| generators-11 | minor | bug | fixed | Model and pricing constants are mislabeled: claude-opus-4-5 is Opus 4.5 (not a 4.7 alias) and $15/$75 is ~3x its actual price |
| generators-12 | minor | bug | fixed | --max or --concurrency passed without a value silently turns the run into a no-op |
| generators-13 | minor | bug | fixed | Poison hint leaks string-concatenation syntax into all 5 poison prompts |
| generators-14 | minor | bug | fixed | Nonsense dead expression in writeDocs: computed path is always slugPath and never used |
| generators-15 | minor | bug | fixed | Scaffold violates its documented contract: the printed template fails eval:query:validate out of the box |
| generators-16 | minor | bug | fixed | Header claims .ts query files are supported but the implementation only JSON.parses |
| generators-17 | major | improvement | fixed | Validate the written corpus-manifest.json against eval/schemas/corpus-manifest.schema.json at generation time |
| generators-18 | major | improvement | fixed | Assert slug uniqueness before writing and derive the manifest count from actual writes |
| generators-19 | minor | improvement | fixed | Record the server-reported model id (resp.model) in cached shards and the ledger instead of trusting the MODEL constant |
| misc-runners-01 | critical | bug | fixed | extractPageLinks called with pre-v0.13 signature: runner crashes and fence-leak checks are vacuous |
| misc-runners-02 | critical | bug | fixed | extractPageLinks Promise iterated synchronously: runner throws before scoring anything |
| misc-runners-03 | major | bug | fixed | injectAmbiguousRole 'works at' branch demands extraction of an entity never inserted into the content |
| misc-runners-04 | major | bug | fixed | substring_collision must_not_extract check is unfailable: FP rate is 0 by construction |
| misc-runners-05 | major | bug | fixed | must_extract.type is never enforced by any consumer: type-downgrade injections can't fail on mistyping |
| misc-runners-06 | major | bug | fixed | As-of accuracy is circular: gold and prediction use the identical algorithm, so it only measures storage roundtrip |
| misc-runners-07 | major | bug | fixed | '2026 full year' range is empty by construction: vacuous 100% dilutes the macro-averaged range metric |
| misc-runners-08 | major | bug | fixed | Unseeded Math.random picks the timed workload: latency distributions are non-reproducible |
| misc-runners-09 | minor | bug | fixed | Percentile index off-by-one at integer ranks: p95 of 20 samples reports the max, p50 reports the upper value |
| misc-runners-10 | minor | bug | fixed | tryOp timeout rejects a plain object and never clears the timer: reason logged as [object Object], process lingers |
| misc-runners-11 | minor | bug | fixed | --scale value parsed with Number() and no validation: NaN yields zero pages and an opaque crash |
| misc-runners-12 | minor | improvement | fixed | timeMany has no warmup: cold first calls land in the distribution and dominate small-n tail percentiles |
| misc-runners-13 | minor | improvement | fixed | P95 threshold breach only prints a warning: the perf eval can never fail |
| misc-runners-14 | minor | improvement | fixed | Pair maps collapse multi-type edges arbitrarily: first inferred type wins, last gold type wins |
| data-integrity-01 | major | bug | fixed | Concurrent Promise.all capture inflates baseline latency_ms ~6x, neutering the latency-regression gate |
| data-integrity-02 | major | bug | fixed | first_relevant_slug contradicts actual retrieval on the reference corpus for 4 of 12 queries; those top-1 labels can never hit |
| data-integrity-03 | major | bug | fixed | README claims CI gates every PR against the baseline/qrels, but no CI exists and nothing in the repo consumes these files |
| data-integrity-04 | major | bug | fixed | Byte-determinism claim is false: wall-clock latency_ms is serialized into every row, so regeneration is never byte-identical |
| data-integrity-05 | minor | bug | fixed | Evidence-contract schema requires probe.text but the real judge evidence uses probe.query; every real artifact fails the published contract |
| data-integrity-06 | minor | bug | fixed | public-probe schema forbids acceptable_variants/known_failure_modes/author, which the real PublicQuery shape retains |
| data-integrity-07 | minor | bug | fixed | as_of_date oneOf branches overlap when format is non-asserting: "corpus-end"/"per-source" match both branches and fail validation |
| data-integrity-08 | minor | bug | fixed | inferType misses the 'deals' and 'personal' slug prefixes used by the qrels, silently typing those pages 'concept' |
| data-integrity-09 | minor | bug | fixed | Header comments misstate the corpus: 24 pages not 12, and zero-vector embeddings not basis-vector |
| data-integrity-10 | minor | bug | fixed | Transcript schema claims it is 'Written by eval/runner/recorder.ts', but the recorder never emits a JSON transcript |
| data-integrity-11 | minor | improvement | fixed | Scorecard schema's cat enum stops at 12 while the suite ships runners through cat34, and no runner emits the schema's shape — wire real validation |
| data-integrity-12 | minor | improvement | fixed | Generator sanity check only warns on empty retrievals and never fails; extend it to enforce qrels consistency and exit non-zero |
| data-integrity-13 | minor | improvement | fixed | Educational soft-seal tests contain an assertion that can never fail; replace with a real static check on adapter sources |
| tests-audit-01 | major | bug | fixed | CATEGORIES expectations drifted: Cat 34 added to all.ts but tests still expect exactly Cats 1-12 |
| tests-audit-02 | major | bug | fixed | Cache-key determinism tests exercise a local re-implementation, not the generator's real cacheKey |
| tests-audit-03 | major | bug | fixed | 'forces expand=false on query tool' test is vacuous — cannot fail if the expand-forcing guard is removed |
| tests-audit-04 | major | bug | fixed | Cat 5 judge prompt leaks the expected label when evidence pages are missing, and cat5.test.ts locks the leak in |
| tests-audit-05 | minor | bug | fixed | injectAmbiguousRole replace-branch gold requires extracting an entity that is absent from the content, deflating Cat 6 recall |
| tests-audit-06 | minor | bug | fixed | LlmBudget is fully tested but wired into nothing — BRAINBENCH_LLM_CONCURRENCY has no effect on any LLM call |
| tests-audit-07 | minor | bug | fixed | Judge-blinding assertions can't fail: the 'poisonous payload' is never injected into the evidence |
| tests-audit-08 | major | improvement | fixed | No coverage for judge omitting rubric criteria — weightedMean silently renormalizes over the returned subset, inflating scores |
| docs-vs-code-01 | major | bug | fixed | BrainBench quick-start claims 'no API keys, fully offline' but eval:run requires OPENAI_API_KEY |
| docs-vs-code-02 | major | bug | fixed | Report claims warm embedding cache 'ships committed' — it is not committed and the path is wrong |
| docs-vs-code-03 | major | bug | fixed | 'Shipping means it runs in CI and gates releases' — repo has no CI, and 3 listed rows are skipped by the master runner |
| docs-vs-code-04 | major | bug | fixed | Reproduce-from-commit claim broken: gbrain dependency floats on #master, not a pinned SHA |
| docs-vs-code-05 | minor | bug | fixed | Methodology claims metrics include '80 tier-5 + tier-5.5' queries that no scorer ever runs |
| docs-vs-code-06 | minor | bug | fixed | Unqualified 'SOTA' claim for 97.60% R@5 contradicts the repo's own comparison table |
| docs-vs-code-07 | minor | bug | fixed | Troubleshooting tells users to run `bun run test:eval` — script does not exist |
| docs-vs-code-08 | minor | bug | fixed | RUNBOOK claims the 'openai' package is a dependency — it is not, and nothing imports it |
| docs-vs-code-09 | minor | bug | fixed | amara-life-v1 described as 'Gitignored; run eval:generate-amara-life once' but the corpus is committed |
| docs-vs-code-10 | minor | bug | fixed | Quick-start `--stratify 10` command silently runs at top-k 8, not the published K=5 |
| docs-vs-code-11 | minor | bug | fixed | Claims 'randomized question order' as a built-in anti-gaming control — not implemented anywhere |
| docs-vs-code-12 | minor | bug | fixed | Headline default-hybrid precision 0.076 does not match its committed backing artifact (0.0752) |
| docs-vs-code-13 | minor | bug | fixed | Reproduction step labels `bun run eval:run` as 'no API keys' — it requires OPENAI_API_KEY |
| docs-vs-code-14 | minor | improvement | fixed | know-to-ask failure rate 0.150 cannot be reconciled with the printed 9/146 — denominator never stated |
| docs-vs-code-15 | minor | improvement | fixed | SkillOpt report commits no backing artifacts — every published number lives only in gitignored eval/reports/ |

## What remained after the audit

The original audit environment lacked the OpenAI key needed for several fresh measurements. Rather than changing historical scores without a run, the reports carried corrections and pending statuses.

Subsequent evidence includes the August 31 offline LongMemEval rescore, the September 2 five-arm run and the [September 6 ranking experiment](../benchmarks/2026-09-06-longmemeval-ranker-wave.md). The [September 9 retrieval refresh](../benchmarks/2026-09-09-retrieval-refresh.md) records the new focused comparisons. Those later results do not rewrite this audit's finding counts.

Provider-matrix reruns, some live negative controls and other unfinished work remain in [TODOS.md](../../TODOS.md). Review the evidence for the particular feature you intend to use; an audit improves the measurement process but cannot establish universal product quality.
